Makes CS:GO Bots better and more fun!

**Make Sure To Enable The "Developer Console" If You Want To Improve Your BOT Experience :D**
*To enable it, press the settings cog located at the bottom left of the screen and proceed to navigate to the “Game Settings” tab. Browse through the options until you find the “Enable Developer Console” setting. Set it to “Yes”.*

**Commands:**
bot_add (t/ct) (expert/hard/normal/easy) (rank) - You can add bots with this command
bot_kick - You can kick bots with this command. If you only want to kick 1 bot, add the bot's name after the command.

**Personality:**
Each bot has its own personality. You may find a bot being more aggressive than others, liking the AK-47 more than the M4A4, etc..
